# SupportApp-Extension / Time Machine Status
WIP!

Used with the Support App:
https://github.com/root3nl/SupportApp

Requires the SupportHelper to run the script as root with the OnAppearScript functionality.

Place the script in /usr/local/bin/ and configure Support App to run the scrip and to show the ExtensionA field.

Enable Extension A
